I am currently a postdoc associate at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART). 
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Southeast University, under supervision of Prof. [Shuai Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gfDfZqAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I am also working with Prof. [Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/) and Prof. [Tian He](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~tianhe/) in research. 
Previously, I was a Graduate Research Trainee at the Cyber Physical Systems Lab, McGill University, under the supervision of Prof. [Xue Liu](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html).

My research interests are broadly in the areas of **Cyber-Physical Systems**, **Human-Centered Computing**, and **Learning-based Decision-Making Applications** in **Smart Logistics**.<br>You can contact me at baoshen.guo AT smart DOT mit DOT edu.
My publications can also be found at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=og2Z6YMAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). 

My long-term research goal is to build **R**obust, **I**nterpretable, **S**afe, and **E**fficient decision-making technologies and AI model for real-world urban systems.

> I am involved in [M3S](https://m3s.mit.edu/), part of MIT' [SMART](https://smart.mit.edu/) program as a Postdoc in Fall 2024! I am open to research discussion and collaboration, please drop me an email if you are interested!
