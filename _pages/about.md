I am currently a postdoc associate at the Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology (SMART), work with Prof. [Jinhua Zhao](https://mobility.mit.edu/people/jinhua-zhao) and Prof. [Shenhao Wang](https://dcp.ufl.edu/urp/people_wang_s/). 

Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from Southeast University, under supervision of Prof. [Shuai Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gfDfZqAAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I am also working with Prof. [Desheng Zhang](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~dz220/) and Prof. [Tian He](https://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~tianhe/) in research. 
I did one year of research at McGill University, Montreal as a Graduate Research Trainee, under the supervision of Prof. [Xue Liu](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~xueliu/site/intro.html).

My research interests are broadly in the areas of **Generative AI**, **Human-Centered Computing**, and **Learning-based Decision-Making** in **Smart Cities** and **Urban Cyber-Physical Systems**. 


My long-term research goal is to build **R**obust, **I**nterpretable, **S**afe, and **E**fficient reinforcement learning and generative AI models for real-world urban systems.
